# Target Audience Analysis
### Task Descriptionüìú
Currently we are facing a lack of Customers and Audience on our LinkedIn  Page. The goal of this task is to get as many people as we can so that we can attract them from our posts and sell them our services to generate revenue. With LinkedIn scraping, we'll be able to collect a data pool of people with their details, where we can identify who can become our Target Audience.
We‚Äôll use the profile URLs of likers and commenters, for scraping profile data like (Name, Title, Followers, Connection, Experience, Curren/Last Designation, Certifications, Skills, and Education) by using the profile scraper code. Make a copy of this profile data, and store this data along with the posts.
With this invaluable data at our fingertips, We‚Äôll categorize the profiles into 8-10 different categories on the basis of the Skills column. Our mission is to uncover potential clients!
Once we've revealed the secrets, we'll get an idea of which kind of audiences are mostly attracted to which kind of posts, so that we can customize our future posts according to this information.
Together, we will unlock the full potential of LinkedIn and elevate Ozigen's online presence to new heights!
